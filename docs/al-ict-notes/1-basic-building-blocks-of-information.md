# Data and information

## Data

video clips and so on. Non of which, on their own have any meaning.  
Example:

- 61300
- 61000

## Information

Information is data that has been given meaning. Which often results from the processing of data, sometimes by a computer.

Example:

- 61300 - Postal code of Puttalam
- 61000 - Postal code of Chilaw

Note: Information helps us to make decisions while data is just raw facts.

### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data is numerical and acquired through counting or measuring. Quantitative data can be arranged and ordered.

Eg:- Goodwill of a company (We can't measure it but we can identify it)

Ordering the goodwill from top to bottom by mobile manufacturers.

- Accuracy  
  Example:

  - Planning a movie night with friends and saying the time is in the evening rather than the exact time 7.00 pm is not accurate.

- Completeness  
  Example:

  - Explaining a recipe without mentioning the main ingredient is not complete.

- Understandability  
  Example:
  - Explaining a complex topic in a simple way is important for the audience to understand.

keeping data securely and making them accessible necessarily are done while management of data. When the data is outdated and found to be unnessessary its time to remove that data from the system.

## Value of Information

value of information in it's maximum level at the moment of information is created or the information is released. The value of information is reduced gradually with the time and become less valuable.
