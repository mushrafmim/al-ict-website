# 1.2 Need of Technology to Create, Disseminate and Manage Data and Information

**Decision Making** - Information helps to make decisions.

Example: Release date of a new movie and a theatre that is showing it helps to make a decision on when and where to watch the movie.

**Policy Making**

Example: Government uses information to make policies. Eg:- Government uses information about the number of accidents in a particular area to make a decision on building a new road.

**Predictions** - Information helps to predict future events.

Example: Walmart kept beer next to diapers because they found out that people who buy diapers also buy beer.

**Planning, Scheduling and Monitoring** - Information helps to plan, schedule and monitor activities.

Example: A school uses information about the number of students in each class to plan the number of teachers needed.

## Data Processing Methods

1. Manual Data Processing
2. Automated Data Processing

### 01. Manual Data Processing

Done by humans using pen, paper, pencils, forms, tables, cupboards, etc.

#### Disadvantages

1.  Data Duplication  
    Example: As a Stilankan atizen I have to fill 1005 of forms that is asking foton first name and last name instead of giving my ID card.

2.  Errors and Delaying In Processing  
    Example: SriLankan government officers take 2 or 3 days to return documents.

3.  Lack of Sharing Information

4.  Data inconsistency  
    Example: changing a person's name reques updating his name on each an every docoments (passport, O/L resultsheet, birth certificate, etc.)

## 02. Automated Data Processing

Done by computers using software and hardware.

#### Advantages

1. Less human touch  
   Example: Eg: Automated term marks analysis (Reduces manual calculations of avarage, rank, total)

2. Handles data more efficiently  
   Example: After manual analysis of term marks increasing the marks of a subject causes reanalysing manualy.

#### Automated Systems are highly needed:

Automated systems are highly needed in these situations.

- Emergency broadcast signals.
- Security and whather advisories.
- millitary
- large companies and Power stations.

# What Is ICT?

Technology behind the creation of information Is known as **Information Technology**.

Technology incooperates with dissemination of information From place to place Is known as **Communication Technology**.

Thus, **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** is the technology behind the creation, dissemination and management of information.
